                <p>Mexican Interdisciplinary artist based in Miami, currently in residence at Bakehouse Art Complex. Her work is focused on probing the convergence of technology, identity, and representation in the digital age. Through her work with AI, net-art, and computers, she questions our comprehension of the self, and the influence of the internet, especially social media, on our existence.</p>

                    <p>A visual spectacle of e-waste, surveillance cameras, mannequins, glitter, gemstones, LEDs, and girly aesthetics, Larios' installations evoke a sense of warmth and nostalgia while simultaneously challenging viewers to consider the environmental toll of technology. Her work challenges audiences to ponder on how technology molds our understanding of self through personal data, and invites a critical examination of our digital lives, for example, the ramifications of how the intimate details of our lives are exploited by corporations and governments.</p>
